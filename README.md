I'm getting back into programming and I need a intermediate project to practice my git and python skills.

Basic Plan for PyChess
Pieces are stored in a 2d array 
Will be drawn by a Draw() function
White starts, player chooses a move 
Checks if its a valid move first based on move set, but then the current board state
move is either valid or not, change the data structure to reflect the move and redraw the board

add a scoreboard
use a graphics library to render a prettier board
