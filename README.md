I'm getting back into programming and I need a intermediate project to practice my git and python skills.

Basic Plan for PyChess

Pieces are stored in a 2d array 

Will be drawn by a Draw() function

White starts, player chooses a move 

Checks if its a valid move first based on move set, but then the current board state

move is either valid or not, change the data structure to reflect the move and redraw the board

add a scoreboard
use a graphics library to render a prettier board

CURRENT STATE
    Piece movesets complete
    ROOK - DONE
    BISHOP - DONE
    KNIGHT - DONE
    QUEEN - DONE
    PAWN - NOT DONE
    KING - NOT DONE

    Check Path for valid move
    ROOK - DONE
    BISHOP - DONE
    QUEEN - DONE
    KNIGHT - DONE
    PAWN - NOT DONE
    KING - NOT DONE

    Movement Tests
    ROOK - DONE
    BISHOP - DONE
    QUEEN - DONE
    KNIGHT - NOT DONE
    PAWN - NOT DONE
    KING - NOT DONE
    
    Playing the game
    NOT DONE
